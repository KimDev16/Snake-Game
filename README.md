# Snake Game
## MonoGame


The Snake game is a classic video game where the player controls a long, thin creature resembling a snake, which moves around on a bordered plane, collecting items (often fruit), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing field. Each time the snake eats a piece of fruit, it grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging. The player typically uses the arrow keys to control the snake's direction (up, down, left, or right). The primary goal is to score as many points as possible by consuming fruit, while the game ends if the snake collides with itself or the wall. The game increases in difficulty as the snake's length increases, demanding greater precision and planning from the player.
